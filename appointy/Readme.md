# no external libraries are used for the creation of this project
# has problem in routing with external agent aof mongo db as gorila mux or any other third party library was not allowed to be connected in the project 


imported libraries :
"context"

"time"



2 structs are created namely:User and Post 

 Mongo DB has ben succesfully connected 

 Because no external library was allowed data couldnt be pulled frm mongo db but here we have created an restapi that works on GO having data in the script and is succesful in displaying that.
